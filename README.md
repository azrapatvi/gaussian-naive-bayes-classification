# Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)** model using **scikit-learn**.  
The model is trained on a dataset and evaluated using standard regression performance metrics.

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics
- **R² Score** – Measures how well the model explains the variance in the target variable
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – Average absolute difference between actual and predicted values
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** – Average squared difference between actual and predicted values
